	abstract = {In terms of inclusive school development, a question is what factors enhance successful implementation of inclusive practices. The present study applies the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as a whole and in differentiated components related to the teacher intentions to implement inclusive practices. Data were collected from 585 primary school teachers in Germany. Multi-level multivariate regression models were computed to test the correlation of attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control with teacher intention to implement inclusion. All components investigated showed a significant relationship with teacher intention. Differentiated examination provides indications of opportunities for the development of an inclusive school system.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Development of self-concept and task interest has been shown to be affected by social comparison processes in a variety of cross-sectional studies. A potential explanation for these effects is an effect of social comparative performance feedback on an individual’s self-evaluation of performance, which in turn influences development of self-concept and task interest. There are, however, only few studies addressing this topic with experimental designs. This study was aimed at closing this research gap by experimentally manipulating social comparative performance. Feedback given was based on 2 × 2 experimental conditions: social position (high vs. low) and average performance of the reference group (high vs. low). Results show a strong effect of social position on self-evaluation of performance and smaller effects on self-concept and task interest.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The well-being of primary students at school plays a pivotal role in the emotional development of students and fosters a positive emotional connection with schooling and the learning process. In conceptualizing well-being and developing approaches to promote it, the voice of primary school children is increasingly being recog­ nized as crucial. This study investigates primary school children’s understanding of well-being, focusing on their perceptions of basic psychological needs according to the self-determination theory of Ryan \& Deci (2000). Ten focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 42 primary students in order to explore their perspectives on well-being at school and their basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and social relatedness. The data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Our findings indicate, that children associate social relatedness and competence with well-being and, apparently, place less importance on autonomy for well-being at school.},
