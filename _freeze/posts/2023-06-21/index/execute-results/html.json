Specifically, predictors\ncan have values outside $\\{0, 1\\}$ and are not continuous and normal\ndistributed. A common solution for this problem is to apply a\ngeneralization of the linear regression model which is (surprise,\nsurprise) called the generalized linear model (GLM). One aspect of the\ngeneralized linear model is that the linear combination of the\npredictors (linear because we assume that the added up predictors are\ninterval scaled) are linked to the distribution of the outcome variable\nvia a function which is called: the link function (uhhh).\n\nIt is helpful to keep in mind that for dichotomous variables, we\nestimate the probabilities that $y=1$. That is, the predicted values are\nprobabilities of $[0, 1]$ (a continuous interval *between* 0 and 1) and\nnot $\\{0, 1\\}$ (either 0 *or* 1). Therefore, we are looking for a link\nfunction that turns the linear combined predictors into a probability\nestimation. In case of a logistic regression, the predictors $y$ is\ntransformed to values from $[-\\infty, +\\infty]$ where $0$ corresponds to\na 50% probability. The distribution of the transformed $y$ values is a\nlogit distribution and the transformation is called a logit\ntransformation. This kind of function (i.e. a function that links the\ndistribution of linear combinations of the predictors to the\ndistribution of the criteria in a regression) is called a link function.\n\nLogits are the logarithm of the odds of a probability $log(Odds)$. Odds\nis a way to represent the probability of an event: If the odds are four\nagainst one ($4\\over1$), than out of 5 events, 4 have one category of\noutcome and 1 has an opposite outcome (for example, if a horse runs five\nraces and we expect that it will win four races and loose one, the odds\nare $4\\over1$). If the odds are \\< 1, the probability of an event is\nbelow 50%. For example, if the odds are 0.25 = $\\frac{1}{4}$ we expect\nthat the horse will win one out of five races.\n\nCaution: Probabilities and odds can be confused easily but are not\nidentical. A probability of $1\\over4$ would index that a specific\noutcome happens in 1 *out of* 4 events, whereas odds of $1\\over4$ would\nindex that an event has the probability for two possible outcomes of 1\n*against* 4. For this example, odds of $1\\over4$ equals a probability of\n$1\\over5$ equals $0.20$.\n\nThe odds are calculated as:\n\n$$Odds(y_i)=\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=0)}$$\n\nFor example, if we have a probability of 25%, the odds are:\n\n$$Odds=\\frac{0.25}{0.75}={1\\over3}$$\\\nThe formula for calculating logits is:\n\n$$logit(y_i)=log(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=0)})=log(odds)$$\n\nFor example, if we have a 25% probability that is:\n\n$$logit(P=0.25)=log(\\frac{0.25}{0.75})=log({1\\over3})=-1.098612$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(function(x) exp(x)/(1 + exp(x)), from = -6, to = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the logistic function (invers logistic)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identical to plot(function(x) plogis(x), -6,6)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(function(x) log(x/(1-x)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Logit/logistic function](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identical to plot(function(x) qlogis(x))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(function(x) dlogis(x), -6,6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Logit/logistic density function](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
