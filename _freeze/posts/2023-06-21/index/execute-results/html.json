Specifically, predicted values can be outside $\\{0, 1\\}$\nand are not continuous and normal distributed. A common solution for\nthis problem is to apply a generalization of the linear regression model\nwhich is (surprise, surprise) called the generalized linear model (GLM).\nOne aspect of the generalized linear model is that the linear\ncombination of the predictors (linear because we assume that the added\nup predictors are interval scaled) are linked to the distribution of the\noutcome variable via a function which is called: the link function\n(uhhh).\n\nIt is helpful to keep in mind that for dichotomous variables, we\nestimate/predict the probabilities that $y=1$. That is, the predicted\nvalues are probabilities of $[0, 1]$ (a continuous interval *between* 0\nand 1) and not $\\{0, 1\\}$ (either 0 *or* 1). Therefore, we are looking\nfor a link function that turns the linear combined predictors into a\nprobability estimation. In case of a logistic regression, we need a\nformula, that turns continuous values from $[-\\infty, +\\infty]$ to a\nprobability (where $0$ corresponds to a 50% probability) and vise-versa,\na probability into a continuous scale with values from\n$[-\\infty, +\\infty]$. This transformation is called a logit\ntransformation and the distribution of the transformed predicted $y$\nvalues is a logistic distribution. This kind of function (i.e. a\nfunction that links the distribution of linear combinations of the\npredictors to the distribution of the criteria in a regression) is\ncalled a link function.\n\n## The logit transformation\n\nThe formula to turn probabilities into continuous values (here logits)\nis:\n\n$$logit(y_i)=log(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=0)})=log(odds)$$\n\nHere is the function plot for illustration with probabilities on x and\nlogits on y:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identical: plot(function(x) qlogis(x))\nplot(function(x) log(x/(1-x)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Logit/logistic function](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe formula to turn continuous values (here logits) into probabilities\nis:\n\n$$P(y_i=1)=\\frac{exp(x)}{1 + exp(x)}$$\n\nHere is the function plot for illustration with logits on x and\nprobablities on y:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identica: plot(function(x) plogis(x), -6,6)\nplot(function(x) exp(x)/(1 + exp(x)), from = -6, to = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the logistic function (invers logistic)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## What are logits?\n\nLogits are the logarithm of the odds of a probability $log(Odds)$. Odds\nis a way to represent the probability of an event: If the odds are four\nagainst one ($4\\over1$), than out of 5 events, 4 have one category of\noutcome and 1 has an opposite outcome (for example, if a horse runs five\nraces and we expect that it will win four races and loose one, the odds\nare $4\\over1$). If the odds are \\< 1, the probability of an event is\nbelow 50%. For example, if the odds are 0.25 = $\\frac{1}{4}$ we expect\nthat the horse will win one out of five races.\n\n::: callout-caution\nCaution: Probabilities and odds can be confused easily but are not\nidentical. A probability of $1\\over4$ would index that a specific\noutcome happens in 1 *out of* 4 events, whereas odds of $1\\over4$ would\nindex that an event has the probability for two possible outcomes of 1\n*against* 4. For this example, odds of $1\\over4$ equals a probability of\n$1\\over5$ equals $0.20$.\n:::\n\nThe odds are calculated as:\n\n$$Odds(y_i)=\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=0)}$$\n\nFor example, if we have a probability of 25%, the odds are:\n\n$$Odds=\\frac{0.25}{0.75}={1\\over3}$$\\\nThe formula for calculating logits is:\n\n$$logit(y_i)=log(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=0)})=log(odds)$$\n\nFor example, if we have a 25% probability that is:\n\n$$logit(P=0.25)=log(\\frac{0.25}{0.75})=log({1\\over3})=-1.098612$$\n\n## Example\n\nTo be continued ðŸ˜‰\n\n\n\n",
