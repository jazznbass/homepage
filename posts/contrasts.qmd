# Example dataset

Create a random dataset with criteria `y`, predictors `x1`, `x2` and `gender`.

- y and gender are correlated
- y and x1 are correlated ***only if gender is 1***
- y and x1 are correlated ***only if gender is 1***
- x1 and x2 are correlated
- x1 and x2 have an interaction effect on y ***only if gender is 1***

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
n <- 2000
gender <- rep(0:1, each = n/2)
y <- sample(0:10, n, replace = TRUE) + gender * sample(0:10, n, replace = TRUE)
x1 <- sample(0:10, n, replace = TRUE) + gender * y
x2 <- x1 + sample(0:10, n, replace = TRUE) + gender * y
y <- y + (x1 > median(x1) & x2 > median(x2) & gender == 1) * sample(0:10, n, replace = TRUE) * 2

dat <- data.frame(y = y, x1 = x1, x2 = x2, gender = gender)
```

# Descriptives

```{r}
psych::corr.test(dat)
psych::describe(dat)
```

# Contrasts

The left part of the table is with gender as treatment contrast (0 vs. 1) and the right part with gender as effect contrast (-1 vs. 1)

```{r}
# Gender has values 0 vs. 1 (treatment contrast)
fit1 <- lm(y ~ gender * x1 * x2, data = dat)

# Gender hast -1 vs. 1 (effect contrast)
dat$gender <- car::recode(dat$gender, "0 = -1; 1 = 1")

fit2 <- lm(y ~ gender * x1 * x2, data = dat)

sjPlot::tab_model(fit1, fit2, show.se = TRUE, show.ci = FALSE, col.order = c("est", "se", "std.est", "p"), digits = 4, dv.labels = c("Treatment contrast<br> for gender", "Effect contrast<br> for gender"))
```

- The `intercept` in model1 (treatment contrast) is the mean of `y` for *gender 0*
- The `intercept` in model2 (effect contrast) is the mean of `y` for *all data*
- All predictors in model1 without a `gender` term are effects for *gender 0* while the interactions with a `gender` term are effects for *gender 1*
- All predictors in model2 without a `gender` term are effects *across gender* while the interactions with a `gender` term are the effects of `gender` (subtracted for *gender 0* and added for *gender 1*).
- `gender` has a significant effect on `y` in both models
- `x1`, `x2` and `x1*x2` only have a significant effect on `y` in model 2
- All `gender` interactions are significant in both models.
