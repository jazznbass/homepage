I thought it was necessary to have a center for all my web activities, a place where someone who is interested in my work can start off. Here it is!

The menu bar on top is pretty self-explaining:

|                  |                                                                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Projects**     | If you are looking for past or present projects I am working on: here is the place                 |
| **Publications** | From any place, this is the one that you get my most recent publication list                       |
| **Alumni**       | A list of great people that I had the pleasure to supervise and accompany through their graduation |
| **Links**        | From here, you get to many of the other places I am presented on the web                           |
| **About**        | Here find information on my career                                                                 |
