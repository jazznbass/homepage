I thought it was necessary to have a center for all my web activities, a place where someone who is interested in my work can start off.

Here it is!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The menu bar on top is pretty much self-explanatory:

|                                       |                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Projects**](projects.html)         | If you are looking for past or present projects I am working on: here is the place                         |
| [**Publications**](publications.html) | From any place, this is the one that you get my most recent publication list                               |
