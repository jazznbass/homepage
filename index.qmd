Welcome to the central hub of my academic and professional work. This site serves as a gateway for anyone interested in my research and contributions to special education.

I am Jürgen Wilbert, a Professor of Special Education at the University of Münster, Germany. Prior to this, I held a professorship in Research Methods and Diagnostics at the University of Potsdam. My academic journey began at the University of Cologne, where I studied educational sciences and later earned my doctorate in cognitive psychology. Following this, I accepted a permanent role as a senior researcher in Special Education and later habilitated at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg on Pedagogy and Psychology in Learning Disabilities.

My research primarily focuses on:

-   Single-case research designs and the nuanced analysis and reporting of single-case data.
-   Promoting social inclusion and participation within the classroom.
-   Learning disabilities, with an emphasis on evidence-based approaches to diagnosis and intervention.
-   Advancing Open Science and Data Science methodologies within the field of special education research.

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that research outcomes translate into tangible improvements for educators and students alike.
