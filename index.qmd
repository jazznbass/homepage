# Hello!

![](images/texel-2023-2.jpg){style="float: right;  margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 30%" width="300"}

This is the centre of all my web activities, a place where anyone interested in my work can start.

My name is Jürgen Wilbert. I am a Professor of Research Methods and Diagnostics at the Department of Inclusive Education at the University of Potsdam in Germany. I studied education at the University of Cologne, where I also did my doctorate in cognitive psychology. I then obtained a permanent position as a senior researcher at the Department of Special Education. I later habilitated at the Carl-von-Osietzky University of Oldenburg on the topic of "Pedagogy and Psychology in Learning Disabilities".

My work focuses on:

-   Single-case research designs, analyzing single case data, and reporting single-case based results.
-   Social inclusion and social participation in classrooms.
-   Implementation of Open Science and Data Science concepts into special education research.
