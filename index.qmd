-   Intervention-oriented assessment and diagnostics in special education.

-   Social inclusion and participation within the classroom.

<!--# I am a Professor of Special Education at the University of M체nster, Germany. Prior to this, I held a professorship in Research Methods and Diagnostics at the University of Potsdam. My academic journey began at the University of Cologne, where I studied educational sciences and later earned my doctorate in cognitive psychology.
