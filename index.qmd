# Hello!

This is the center of all my web activities, a place where anyone interested in my work can start.

My name is Jürgen Wilbert. I am a Professor of Special Education at the University of Münster in Germany. Before that I have been a Professor for Research Methods and Diagnostics at the University of Potsdam. I studied education at the University of Cologne, where I also did my doctorate in cognitive psychology. I then obtained a permanent position as a senior researcher at the Department of Special Education. I later habilitated at the Carl-von-Osietzky University of Oldenburg on the topic of "Pedagogy and Psychology in Learning Disabilities".

My work focuses on:

-   Single-case research designs, analysis of single-case data, and reporting of single-case based results.
-   Social inclusion and social participation the classroom.
-   Implementation of Open Science and Data Science concepts in special education research.
